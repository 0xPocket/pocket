          you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to
          use some of the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to
          provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and
          e-mail address).

          Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the

          Information about you from other sources such as social media
          platforms and our joint partners. Personal Information we collect from
          other sources may include demographic information, such as age and

          submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. If
          you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has

          We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their

          instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
          through the Website and Services without their permission. We also ask
          that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children
          take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are
          instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without
          their permission.

          we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to
          ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such

          a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is
          related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the

          circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:
        </p>
        <p>
          (i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously
          given your consent to the processing of your Personal Information. To
          the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal
          Information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at
          any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing

          processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the
          processing, and obtain a copy of your Personal Information undergoing
          processing.

          request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is
          incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          (iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your
          information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other
          than consent. Where Personal Information is processed for the public
          interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us, or
          for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may
          object to such processing by providing a ground related to your
          particular situation to justify the objection.

          (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
          processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances include:
          the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we
          must verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose
          the erasure of your Personal Information and request the restriction
          of its use instead; we no longer need your Personal Information for
          the purposes of processing, but you require it to establish, exercise
          or defend your legal claims; you have objected to processing pending
          the verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your
          legitimate grounds. Where processing has been restricted, such
          Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the
          exception of storage, will be processed only with your consent or for
          the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims, for the
          protection of the rights of another natural, or legal person or for
          reasons of important public interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          (vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the
          erasure of your Personal Information from us. These circumstances
          include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation
          to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you
          withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the
          processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the
          processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data
          have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the
          right to erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising
          the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance
          with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or
          defense of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you
          have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and
          machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it
          transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from us,
          provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the rights
          and freedoms of others.

          about our collection and use of your Personal Information. If you are
          not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you
          have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
          authority. For more information, please contact your local data
          protection authority in the EEA. This provision is applicable provided
          that your Personal Information is processed by automated means and

          are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

          websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal
          is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet
          set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by
          your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this
          Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.

          confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third

          The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not
          owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible
          for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
          encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and

        <h2 id="information-security">Information security</h2>
        <p>
          We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
          secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or
          disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
          physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized
          access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in
          our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the
          Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
          acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the
          Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity,
          and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you
          and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such
          information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a
          third party, despite best efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the
          security of the device you use to communicate with us and the security
          you use to protect your credentials, please take appropriate measures
          to protect this information.

          Services has been compromised or Users&#8217; Personal Information has
          been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external
          activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we
          reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including,
          but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
          notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In
          the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify
          affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of
          harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
          required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.
