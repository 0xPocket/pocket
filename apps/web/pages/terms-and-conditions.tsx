          using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the

          You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit,
          reformat, display and perform the Content of your user account solely
          as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without
          limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the
          right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion,
          refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates
          any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Unless
          specifically permitted by you, your use of the Website and Services
          does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify,

          You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with
          the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or
          charge is due and payable. Where Services are offered on a free trial
          basis, payment may be required after the free trial period ends, and
          not when you enter your billing details (which may be required prior

          automatically in accordance with the term you selected. If, in our
          judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will
          require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued
          photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement
          for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the
          right to change products and product pricing at any time. We also
          reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in
          our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person,
          per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders
          placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card,
          and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In
          the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt
          to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone
          number provided at the time the order was made.

          IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING DIGITAL ASSETS
        </h2>
        <p>
          AS WITH ANY ASSET, THE VALUE OF DIGITAL ASSETS CAN GO UP OR DOWN AND
          THERE CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT YOU LOSE MONEY BUYING, SELLING,
          TRADING, HOLDING OR INVESTING IN DIGITAL ASSETS SUCH AS CRYPTO
          CURRENCIES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER BUYING, SELLING,
          HOLDING, TRADING OR BUYING DIGITAL ASSETS IS SUITABLE FOR YOU. The
          value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness
          of market participants to exchange Digital Assets for Fiat currencies
          or other Digital Assets. If such willingness is abolished for any
          reason, this may result in the potential for a permanent and total
          loss of value of a particular Digital Asset. The volatility and
          unpredictability of the price of Digital Assets may result in
          significant loss over a short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE TREATMENT OF DIGITAL ASSETS VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BE ADVISED
          THAT IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, DUE TO REGULATORY CONCERNS, POCKET MAY NOT
          PROVIDE PART OR ALL OF THE SERVICES. The Services are not available
          where prohibited by law or by Pocket policy, as updated from time to
          time; currently, such places include, but are not necessarily limited
          to, the countries of Iran, North Korea, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria,
          Cuba, Russia, or any other country against which the United States,
          the United Kingdom or the European Union imposes financial sanctions
          or embargoes. Pursuant to the economic sanctions programs administered
          in the countries where we conduct business our policies are designed
          to comply with these sanctions programs and we may: (i) suspend the
          Service; (ii) terminate the Service; (iii) restrict your Service; (iv)
          return Digital Assets to the destination of their origin or to an a
          location specified by authorities; or (v) block the transfer of
          Digital Assets that are the property of a sanctioned person.
